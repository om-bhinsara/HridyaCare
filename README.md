# ❤️ HridyaCare  
### **Smart, Accessible, Context-Aware & Family-Centric Digital Health Monitoring**

HridyaCare is a **browser-based, family-centric digital health platform** designed to make **heart health, stress, lifestyle, and environmental health monitoring accessible to everyone**, using just a smartphone and the web.  

It is built with a strong focus on **individuals, families, elderly members, and caregivers**, enabling shared awareness and proactive health monitoring within households.

---

## 🚧 Project Status (Important)

> **HridyaCare is currently under active development.**  
> Several features are functional, while others are being continuously refined, expanded, and validated.  
> The platform should be viewed as an **evolving health monitoring and awareness system**, not a finished commercial product.

---

## ⚠️ Device Recommendation

Heart rate monitoring in HridyaCare relies on the **smartphone camera and flash (rPPG technique)**.  
Since most laptops and desktops do **not support continuous camera flash**, this feature is **fully supported only on mobile devices**.

For the **best accuracy and reliability**, users are **strongly advised to access HridyaCare on a smartphone**.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Today’s health monitoring solutions are often:
- **Device-dependent** (require wearables)
- **Data-heavy but insight-poor** (numbers without interpretation)
- **Expensive or inaccessible**, especially in rural, remote, or low-resource regions

As a result, individuals and families often become aware of health risks **only after symptoms escalate**.

HridyaCare bridges this gap by combining **real-time physiological signals, lifestyle patterns, stress assessment, and environmental factors** to provide **clear, human-readable health insights — instantly**.

---
